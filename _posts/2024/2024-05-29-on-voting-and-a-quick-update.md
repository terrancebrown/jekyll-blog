title: On Voting and a Quick Update
tags: ["life updates"]

Today was the national election in South Africa, and I'm proud to say that I did my duty, and voted after standing for over an hour in a queue. It makes me really overjoyed to see how far my country has come with people willing to brave the heat, and long queues to have their say in where our country is heading.

This post is also a roundabout way of letting all of you out there know I am very much still alive!

Hopefully I can get back to some semblance of posting regularly after what has been a rather crazy two years.

Thanks for sticking with me. :)
