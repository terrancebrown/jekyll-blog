Well hello there! It's been almost an age since I've last had a chance to grace this site with any sort of update. You can't say I didn't warn you though!

Thankfully now though most of the niggles that come with changing jobs and moving seem to have been wrestled to the ground and I can finally start adjusting to my new circumstances and environment. That also means that I can finally get back into the groove of typing out the odd blog post and maybe also getting a bit more proactive in terms of my other sites.

The only caveat though is that life has a way of throwing you a curveball when you least expect it and there are also still a few things that I need to sort out in the near future, such as navigating my way through the notoriously strict Japanese driver's license test, which may lead to the odd break in posts.

All that said though, I'm extremely glad to be back behind the keyboard writing out blog posts and I've really missed it these past few months!
