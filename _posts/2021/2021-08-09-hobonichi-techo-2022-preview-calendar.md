With August halfway through, it's that time of year when the [preview for the 2022 Hobonichi planner is released](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/magazine/2022/y22/). I've blogged numerous times before on my obsession with this Japanese planner, and this year will be no exception.

This is always my favourite time of the year, because I get to see a month full of articles about the various covers, collaborations and some interesting interviews about the upcoming 2022 line-up. The actual sales will start over three days: September 1, 2 and 3. 

A couple of my highlights from the preview calendar:

- [Shigesato Itoi has a message](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/magazine/2022/contents/y22_itoi/) for Hobonichi users, and as always it's well written and thoughtful.
- [How to choose the Hobonichi Techo books*](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/magazine/2022/contents/y22_hontaidore/z2clheoeq.html) is a great place to start if you're new to the brand or event the concept of a planner. 
- [How to choose the Hobonichi Techo covers](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/magazine/2022/contents/y22_coverdore/56j85171s.html) can help you narrow down your choice of cover from the huge selection on offer.
- [Introducing the Hobonichi Note](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/magazine/2022/contents/y22_hobonote/pqk639fr3.html) is the début of a new notebook to their line-up, which can be helpful for users who need a gentle nudge to encourage them to write.

At the time of writing this, only one new cover has been previewed, [a collaboration with the Michael Jackson brand](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/magazine/2022/contents/y22_cover_mj/), with plenty of more previews throughout the rest of August 2022. Half the fun of using a Hobonichi is seeing the wide array of covers they come up with and choosing one of your own.

So follow along with the [preview calendar](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/magazine/2022/y22/), and I look forward to starting 2022 with a blank canvas in my Hobonichi planner to chronicle the upcoming year.
