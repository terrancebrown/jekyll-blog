Just this past week, the first image of Amazon's Lord of the Rings series [came out online](https://www.theonering.net/torwp/2021/08/02/111246-official-first-pic-of-amazons-lord-of-the-rings-series-release-confirmed-for-fall-2022/), and I thought I'd give my initial impressions as a fan off the books and Peter Jackson's LotR movie trilogy.

First off, the series is slated to start September 2, 2022 on Amazon Prime and has just wrapped up filming in New Zealand after 18 months of shooting. Hopefully in just over a year or so, I'll be settling in to watch a rather exciting series that will return to the beautiful world of JRR Tolkien's Middle Earth.

The image itself looks gorgeous and has a very similar feel to the movie trilogy, which is no bad thing to say. The scope looks fantastic, and is something I think that is essential in conveying the immensity of the Hobbit's mission in destroying the one ring. You have to *feel* how gargantuan their task must feel by seeing the scope of the world lying ahead of them.

I'm still a bit cautious, simply because everything good about Peter Jackson's movies was tarnished by the Hobbit trilogy, that just lost everything that made the original movies special.

I can only hope that Amazon, Patrick McKay and J.D. Payne have the same reverence for the original source material that fans across the globe have.

Come this time next year, we'll be able to see the final product for ourselves.
