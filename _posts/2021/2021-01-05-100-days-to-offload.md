One of the things I want to accomplish in 2021 is to write more. and just by luck I stumbled on a rather cool initiative on Mastodon the other day: #100DaysToOffload.

The concept is pretty simple, just write 100 posts on your personal site within a year.

There's no pressure to write a novel or a viral post or anything really. It's just a goal to get the words out of your head and onto the screen. Posts can be long or short, indepth or simple. You can write about whatever comes to mind.

And this is exactly the sort of thing I needed to get my writing gears moving again. 80% of writing for me comes down to making it a habit. If I don't sit down every day to write something I end up just leaving it indefinitely and never getting around to it. It's pretty easy to see how tha amount of posts I've written on this site have steadily decreased yer after year and that's not because I have nothing to write about, it jsut comes from laziness.

Hopefully I can use #100DaysToOffload as a springboard to get my creative juices flowing again and hone my writing skills a bit more.
