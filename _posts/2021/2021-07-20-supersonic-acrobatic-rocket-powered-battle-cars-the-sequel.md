title: Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars (The Sequel)

Rocket League, the sequel to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, has proven to be one of my favourite gaming experiences in a *long* time. I haven't put so much time into an online multiplayer game since my Halo 3 days. So why is a game based around the concept of car soccer so addictive?

I think the reason that I find Rocket League so fun and addictive is simply because of the camaraderie and fun I have while playing the game with friends. Despite being a lowly Gold rank player, I still have heaps of fun heading out as a team into competitive games. And whether we win or lose, it feels great to have this chance to socialize over a game.

Of course, it also helps that Rocket League has a lot of depth to its gameplay mechanics. You're always learning something new and improving, even though there are days when I feel extremely inept and stupid as I tilt and fall down the ranks.

Despite the trolls and abuse that can be found in online gaming, I think being able to play with friends online, especially during the epidemic, has proven to be one of the greatest advances in gaming, and I look forward to many more hours of Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars (aka Rocket League).
