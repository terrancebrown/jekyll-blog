Just a quick follow up from my [previous post]({% post_url /2021/2021-08-09-hobonichi-techo-2022-preview-calendar %}) to highlight two covers that have immediately caught my eye and might be worth your hard-earned money if you're looking to start using a techo in 2022.

The first cover, is [Animal Crossing: New Horizons What shall we do today?](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/magazine/2022/contents/y22_cover_atsumori/ow3524d9m.html), which features a design highlight the island and characters from the popular Nintendo Switch game. During lockdown, this game blew up in terms of popularity, and I'm sure the cover will do just as well when it releases later in September.

Next, is [MOTHER EarthBound Beginnings](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/magazine/2022/contents/y22_cover_mother/ow3524d9m.html) which features a simple design taken from the first game in the [MOTHER trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_(video_game_series)). These MOTHER cover designs are extremely popular every year, and the simplicity of this year's design is right up my alley.

Of course, both these designs might not go down to well if you're using a tech in a serious office environment, but they are excellent for a techo that you use outside of work in your everyday life.

Be sure to check out the [2022 Preview Calendar](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/magazine/2022/y22/) for further cover designs as they are announced during the month before the final reveal and sale.
