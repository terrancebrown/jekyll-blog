I recently picked up a [Keychron K2](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard) mechanical keyboard that was on special, and I've fallen in love with the tactile feel of typing with mechanical switches.

In all honesty, I've had a cheap mechanical keyboard before, but it's stuck halfway across the world during these COVID-19 lockdown times.

So when this sale popped up, I jumped at the chance to hop back on board the mechanical keyboard hype train, and I don't regret it one bit.

If you haven't used a good mechanical keyboard before, I can highly recommend any of the Keychron keyboards or one of the numerous affordable options out there. Who knows, maybe it'll get me to write a bit more frequently here!
