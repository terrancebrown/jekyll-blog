One of my enduring loves is music. I've always been fascinated by music's ability to change your mood, whether it be lifting you up out of sad times or bringing back sad memories of past losses.

I've always enjoyed putting on earphones and closing my eyes while I drift away into the space between the notes of whatever music I'm listening to and one of the best bands for me to lose myself in has always been Tool.

Back in 2001 I had my first exposure to Tool when I saw the following music video:

Ever since then I've bought every single CD and DVD they have released and I'm still eagerly awaiting their new album even though it has been 10 long years since they released their last album, _10,000 Days_.

To try to describe their music isn't something that I find easy to do. They manage to be an alternative band that also has bits of progressive metal while at the same time managing to become something altogether _unique._

I recently just watched their music video for _Schism_ (embedded above) and was blown away at still how little their music and visual aesthetic has aged.

If you haven't had a chance to sample their music yet then head through to [their site and check it out][1]!
