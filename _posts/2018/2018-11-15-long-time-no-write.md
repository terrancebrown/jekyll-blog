After what seems like an eternity I'm finally getting around to posting again. It's been a whole year that's passed since I've updated this site. I've been far from inactive outside of this site though, so let me finally get around to telling you what I've been up to.

Firstly, and most importantly, I've changed countries and instead of Japan I am now in the far-flung exotic country of China. Shanghai to be more specific. I'm sure that I could write a **whole** more about life in China, and I undoubtedly will, but for now I can say that I am settling nicely into life in China despite having some slight bumps along the way when it comes to cultural differences. But overall China is a country that seems to be constantly changing and evolving which makes living here an adventure.

In terms of my work I'm still teaching English, but this time around I'm at an international school teaching students who are aiming to attend prestigious foreign universities in the future. I'm also doing some writing and proofreading on the side which helps keep my wallet nice and full!

The downside of living in china is that I've gained some weight from all the wonderful food here! Fruits, vegetables, lamb meat and beef are all **much** cheaper than when I was living in Japan and with the popularity of food delivery apps it's also far too tempting to just order in a meal than having to go out to buy groceries after a long day at work and then walk home to cook them.

I also had a chance to enjoy a nice few months back in South Africa and that helped me appreciate just how lucky I am to come from such an amazing country. The people, food and nature in Cape Town are especially without any equal in the world as far as I am concerned.

One small note about this site in particular is that I've finally gotten around to hosting providers, with [A2 Hosting][1] being the site's new home. They might not be as cheap as some other companies out there but their service is amazing and I have no problems with them at all.

So with the site now at a new home and me finally settled down I think it's safe to say that there should be plenty of new blog posts coming up soon!
