It's been almost a year since my last post. 

One of the things you can be most certain about when blogging is that at some point the blog will die. The internet is littered with blogs and sites that have been a hive of activity, only to fade into obscurity once the initial wave of euphoria of posting updates wears off.

I can't same that's happened in this case, more that life and work have just seen me consumed every day with barely any free time to myself. When I do have a chance to relax, I usually spend it watching some TV or gaming. Sadly, my reading has also somewhat waned as the years have passed by.

I'll do my best to make sure that I can at least post every few weeks, though. I'm not even certain anyone reads this anymore!
