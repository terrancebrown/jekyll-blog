I've already written [two]({% post_url /2015/2015-02-18-a-look-at-the-hobonichi-techo %}) [posts]({% post_url /2016/2016-09-06-another-year-another-hobonichi %}) about my experiences with the Hobonichi Techo planner and while I've covered both the A6 Original and the A5 Cousin versions, I haven't had a chance to talk about the smaller Weeks version.

As I'm typing this, the Spring versions of the Hobonichi series of planners has just been released. Every year the Hobonichi guys and gals have two main release dates:

  1. The September release for the year's new books and cover designs for planners that run from January to December of the following year; and
  2. the February release for a few new Spring cover designs as well as planners that run from April of the current year to March of the following year.

Currently I'm using two Hobonichi planners, an original size as my daily journal and a cousin as my work planner where I jot down all the classes I teach and basic outlines of my lessons so that I can refer back to them when planning for future classes.

A couple of years back I was using the smaller Hobonichi Weeks as my daily diary and work planner but I moved up to the Cousin in anticipation of trying to juggle work and studies at the same time. A month into 2017 and I can see that the Cousin is clearly overkill for my needs and the Weeks is far more useful in that it's more portable and has plenty of space for my needs.

So with February 1 arriving, I've decided to pick up a [Linen Weeks][1] to use as my daily planner for work and daily life.

The best thing about the Weeks planner is just how small it is, while at the same time giving you plenty of space to jot down your day's appointments and lessons. Each two page spread covers a week on the left hand side while on the right side you have a sheet of  grid paper that you can use either as a general space to jot down any additional information or as a day by day area.

Towards the end of the planner you also get 76  pages of grid paper that you can use in any way you feel fit. I think I'll use these pages as a [bullet journal][2] at the start and see how that works out.

I think the best part of being a Hobonichi Techo fan is that each of their three planners covers almost anyone's needs. You can even use them in tandem with each other to cover multiple uses.

So with a new batch of students set to arrive at my school from April I'm looking forward to putting my Linen Weeks to good use!
